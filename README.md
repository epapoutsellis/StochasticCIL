# Stochastic Optimisation using CIL 

CIL is an open-source Python framework designed for tomographic imaging and reconstruction of challenging datasets. It offers a modular optimization framework with a focus on inverse problems in imaging, particularly for tomography. 

The library has been extended to incorporate **Stochastic Optimization techniques**, making it ideal for developing and experimenting with algorithms that address complex and large-scale imaging problems, leveraging randomness and sampling to enhance performance.
